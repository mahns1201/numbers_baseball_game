1. The computer is going to select 3 non-duplicated numbers. you shuold find that ANSWER. 
2. Type 3 non-duplicated numbers. than the computer give you some HINT.

                    *HINT's way is this
                     If the array and value is same as ANSWER, it is 1 strike.
                     If only value is same as ANSWER not array, it is 1 ball.
                     If both is not, it will give you nothing.
 
3. finally you get 3-strkies your win.
